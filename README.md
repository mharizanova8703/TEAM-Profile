# Instructions
This is a software engineering team generator command line application.The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests.When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

Some guidelines how we can deliver the project:

* Install npm init package.json (Run npm init.
Fill out the prompts to create your package. json.)
* npm install inquirer (npm install inquirer) 
*  npm install jest (npm install --save-dev jest)
*  Basic file setup (classes in lib, test in a test folder)
*  .gitignore 
*  Get familiar with  Java Script class super( keyword is used to call the constructor)
*  Switch statment
*   Inquirer
  





# Demo

# Run Jest Test
* Runnning from the command line , you can run Jest directly from the CLI.Jest makes testing delightful.
